# Exploring-Xlinix-Vivado-IDE-and-Zybo-Z7
This project is used to understand the Vivado design flow, as well as getting started with Vivado, adding sources, constraints, and simulation files. Also, being able to synthesize, implement, generate bitstreams, program devices, and source control our projects.

## Description
For this project I constructed a Half Adder, Full Adder, and N Bit Fll Adder. I ran simulation for all of these files as well as configured constraint files. This project was used to learn the flow of Vivado and how to program the Zybo-Z7 development board
